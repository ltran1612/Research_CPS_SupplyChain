HOW TO MODEL RELATEDNESS OF REQUIREMENTS ACROSS FUNCTIONS
=========================================================
Definition. A requirement Q addresses a concern C in
function F if there exists an impact rule in which
C is the concern being affected (polarity is irrelevant)
and Q is the requirement of one of the conditions of the
rule.

Definition. Requirement q1 is refined into requirement q2
if they address the same concern in two functions F1 and F2
and F1 is refined into F2.

Definition. Requirement q1 is related to requirement q2
if there is a sequence r_1,...,r_k of requirements such that 
q1 =r_1, q2=r_k, and every r_i is refined into r_i+1.
