Additional competency question:
  What have you done across the system for the sake of confidentiality?


HOW TO ANSWER:

Roughly speaking, the answers to the question
are all properties "attached" to confidentiality and
all properties "attached" to (possibly transitive) sub-concerns
of confidentiality.

Solution:
1. Find every impact rule r such that <r cpsf:addressesConcern c>
and <r cpsf:addressesPolarity positive>
and c is confidentiality of one of its (possibly transitive) sub-concerns
and <r cpsf:addressesAtFunc f>.
2. Return every condition+polarity of r and the function f.
