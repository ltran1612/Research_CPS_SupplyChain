FORMALIZATION OF LINKS BETWEEN REQUIREMENTS AND CONCERNS
========================================================
The satisfaction/dissatisfaction of a concern can be 
affected by an arbitrary conjunction of requirement 
literals (pos/neg requirements) by means of
"impact rules".
Multiple impact rules for the same concern are allowed.
Conflicting conclusions are handled according to the
inference mode.
The encoding is as follows:

Impact rule
-----------
<rule,"cpsf:addressesConcern",concern>
<rule,"cpsf:addressesPolarity",ImpactPolarity> <<<< will be mapped to pos/neg
<rule,"cpsf:addressesAtFunc",function e.g. "cpsf:bc1">

Condition
---------
<rule,"cpsf:hasCondition",cond>
<cond,"cpsf:conditionProperty",property e.g. "cpsf:SAMSecBoot">
<cond,"cpsf:conditionPolarity",ImpactPolarity> <<<< will be mapped to pos/neg
