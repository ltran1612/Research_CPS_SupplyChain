%
% SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
% Input device 1 can operate in one of slow-mode and fast-mode.
% The SAM determines the mode of operation of input device 1.
% Normally, input device 1 reads inputs with a consistent frequency.
% If the basic type of input device 1 is configured to use
% encrypted memory and fast-mode, then the device will be
% unable to maintain a consistent frequency of reading.
%
% CONFIGURATION
% The SAM and input device 1 are configured to use encrypted 
% memory and secure boot. 
% The basic type of input device 1 is used.
% The SAM is configured to set input device 1 to slow-mode.
%
% Questions:
%   1. Is the functionality concern satisfied?
%   2. Is the functional aspect satisfied?
%   3. Are all aspects satisfied?
% 
% Answers:
%   1. Yes
%   2. Yes (because all concerns and sub-concerns of functional aspect are satisfied)
%   3. Yes (because all aspects are satisfied)
