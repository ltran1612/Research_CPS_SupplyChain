It is quite comprehensive, hopefully spelling out all of its current functions. 

Outside of that, some key information:

- The packages are hard to get right. Use the correct .yml file for your OS in the interface/testing/ folder to create an anaconda environment. You might have to run "dot -c" in a command prompt afterwards.

- OntologyGUI.py is the main file to run

- As is the interface will load ontologies from the folder "workshop_ontologies/". This can be changed on (currently) lines 354 and 372 in OntologyGUI.py. It will save base ontologies to workshop_ontologies/ and application ontologies to a folder used in the query picker. These can be changed on lines 387 and lines 409.

- The main ontologies are stored in "workshop_ontologies/". Others used throughout testing are in application_ontologies. 

- V1 versions of the ontologies don't support formulas/dependencies. V2 versions do. The editor can handle both, the query picker can only handle V1.
