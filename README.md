# OEC Version 2

This is an old branch containing the code for the agent environment system version 2 where users can describe their domain with anything and the state calculator works by calculating the state of each agent using only the agent's domain and a global shared domain. Then, the state calculator combines the individual states to make a global state. 

Users of the system can write some custom scripts to enforce constraints on the global state and resolve conflicts.
